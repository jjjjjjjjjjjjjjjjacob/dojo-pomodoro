                SMS notifications are optional. When you affirmatively select the SMS opt-in for a specific event, you consent to receive messages from that event&apos;s host (for example, Party Nights Presents). Messages are sent by Jeans on behalf of the event host using Dojo Pomodoro as a messaging platform service provider. You may withhold or withdraw that consent at any time.
